    Islamic Family & Social Services Association(IFSSA) \n
    is a culturally and spiritually sensitive social service provider whose services are open to all. IFSSA works on addressing the security, safety and growth needs of its clients through a range of programming that includes culturally appropriate food hampers, crisis support, domestic violence intervention, refugee support, preventative youth programming and more. IFSSA has been the leading voice against domestic violence in the Alberta Muslim community for over 25 years.

    Project Overview: \n
    Islamic Family & Social Services Association Project aims to make the best use of machine learning techniques to predict the number of food hampers based on three factors i.e. Seasonality, Special Occasions, and Family Size. Our predictions will help the organization to plan inventory, staffing, and resource allocation particularly during¬†peak¬†periods.

    Problem Statement: \n
    The challenges faced by the Islamic Family & Social Services Association are to manage the inventory and staff based on three factors, i.e., seasonality, special occasions and family size especially during the peak periods. Therefore, there is a need to optimize the Islamic Family & Social Services Association by providing better solutions for enhancing the overall food hampers by planning inventory, staffing, and resource allocation particularly during peak periods.
