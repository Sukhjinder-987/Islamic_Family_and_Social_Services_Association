Project Overview
Islamic Family & Social Services Association Project aims to make the best use of machine learning techniques to predict the number of food hampers based on three factors i.e. Seasonality, Special Occasions, and Family Size. Our predictions will help the organization to plan inventory, staffing, and resource allocation particularly during peak periods.

Problem Statement
The challenges faced by the Islamic Family & Social Services Association are to manage the inventory and staff based on three factors, i.e., seasonality, special occasions and family size especially during the peak periods. Therefore, there is a need to optimize the Islamic Family & Social Services Association by providing better solutions for enhancing the overall food hampers by planning inventory, staffing, and resource allocation particularly during peak periods.
